Memory Management

Files that should be in this directory:
	-main.c
	-oss.c
	-user.c
	-info.h
	-Makefile
	-hidden .git directory
	-this README
	-test.out

Getting started: Type the command: make proj5
	Files should compile and you should be left with 3 executables in the directory: proj4, oss, and user.

Running proj5: the only valid options for this project are:
	-s w/arg
	-h (for help text)
	no args will use defaults that are hardcoded into program

Things not implemented in this project:
	-Logging, started but not working
	-Starting more processes on after other children have finished executing
	-Timeout on alarm/signal handling to clean up memory
	-Message passing
	-Deadlock calculation
	
Struggles:
	I burned so much of my time just trying to get the shared memory to allocate and deallocate in the correct way,
	I didn't end up being able to get through even some of the first steps.
	Definitely chased a lot of pointer errors
	I did get what I consider a good base in info.h to use for PCBs and RCBs
	
Final Words:
	It appears the little bits and pieces (some of them a little bigger) missing from each project is starting to finally catch up with me.
	I'm struggling to get to the point where I can focus on the actual current project and wasting my time backtracking to try and get items from previous projects working, as they are essential to the current projects.
	In all honesty, the amount of time required to do these projects well really makes me wonder why this class is a 3 credit class. I've never experienced a class of this "caliber" I guess. Even at the end of the semester, feeling pretty outclassed by the project load.
